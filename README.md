Usage
The provided Python script demonstrates how to interact with the Starling-7B model for various language generation tasks. The script showcases three scenarios:

Single-turn Conversation: Asking a question and obtaining a response.
Multi-turn Conversation: Continuing a conversation with multiple exchanges.
Coding Prompt: Generating code based on a provided prompt.
Ensure the transformers library and its dependencies are installed. Modify the prompts in the script or create your own prompts to interact with the model.

Example Prompts
Modify the prompt variables in the code to experiment with different inputs. For instance:

For a question: prompt = "What is AI?"
For a coding prompt: code_prompt = "Write a FastAPI code to develop a REST API."
Acknowledgments
This code utilizes the Hugging Face transformers library. The model used (berkeley-nest/Starling-LM-7B-alpha) is a product of the BerkeleyNLP group.
